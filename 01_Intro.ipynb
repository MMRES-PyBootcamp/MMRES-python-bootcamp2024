In addition, you will start to hear a bit of Python slang such as *variable*, *comment*, *built-in function*, *integer*, *float*, *string*, *boolean*... Finally, you will be introduced to some of the most fundamental Python operators, in particular to *arithmetic*, *comparison* and *logical* operators."
