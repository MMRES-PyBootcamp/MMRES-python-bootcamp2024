# BIST-master-python-bootcamp

Contents for the scientific python bootcamp of the BIST master of Multidisciplinary Research in Experimental Sciences (2024 course).

The contents of this year's bootcamp are designed based on [2023](https://github.com/MMRES-PyBootcamp/MMRES-python-bootcamp2023), [2022](https://github.com/MMRES-PyBootcamp/MMRES-python-bootcamp2022), [2021](https://github.com/MMRES-PyBootcamp/MMRES-python-bootcamp2021), [2020](https://github.com/germannp/BIST-Python-Bootcamp), and [2019](https://github.com/BorjaRequena/BIST-master-python-bootcamp) editions.

**IMPORTANT**: Make sure you have the learning environment ready **before** coming to the first class on September 12th. Follow the steps below to 1) install python and 2) prepare the `MMRES-python-bootcamp2024` repository on your machine.

Suggested python installation
-----------------------------
1. Distribution: Anaconda3 with Jupyter or JupyterLab (better JupyterLab). Please, refer to the official [Anaconda website](https://www.anaconda.com/download) and follow downloading and installing instructions. Note that you will be prompted to provide an email to get a download link via email.
2. Installation: In order to minimize the problems derived from across-students heterogeneity in the setup process, we reccomend to install Anaconda3 with the default options.
3. Packages: NumPy, Pandas, SciPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Statsmodels, [bioinfokit](https://anaconda.org/bioconda/bioinfokit)\*, [Pytorch](https://anaconda.org/pytorch/pytorch)\* and [Torchvision](https://anaconda.org/pytorch/torchvision)\*. Please note that starred packages are not available after default Anaconda3 setup and thus you should manually install them using [Anaconda Prompt](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/anaconda/packages/install-packages/). Follow the hyperlinks for further help and be patient, Anaconda might take a considerable amount of time to install certain packages (type `y` then intro when prompted with `Proceed ([y]/n)?` when installing that starred packages).

Suggested repository preparation
--------------------------------
1. From this same page, use the `<> Code` green button and then `Download ZIP` option to store a local copy of this repository (don't forget to unzip it). If you are familiar with Git, you can just clone the repository.
2. Open an Anaconda Prompt and navigate to the folder where the just-unzipped just-downloaded repository is locally stored in your machine (for example, by doing `cd C:Users\You\GitHub\MMRES-python-bootcamp2024` or something similar).
3. Type the command `jupyter lab` (you will see how Jupyter Lab opens a new tab in your default web browser).
4. Check that you can successfully load the first Jupyter Notebook called `01_Intro.ipynb` just by double-clicking it (use the "File Browser" pane at the left side of the Jupyter Lab tab).

If you reached this point, you are up and ready to start the bootcamp next September 12th.
