    "In this session, we will explore the tools that Python offers to visualize data. The *art* of making nice plots is something that takes some time, but getting our first plots is really simple. In this tutorial, we will focus in the libraries [Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/) and [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/). Matplotlib provides an absolute control on what you are plotting but often requires more code lines and a pretty handicraft work. With Seaborn you can get really nice plots in just a couple code lines (that's the reason why we choose this package for the boot camp). Like many other Python plotting packages, Seaborn is based in Matplotlib, and at the end of the day, we will use both in conjunction to make our plots."
